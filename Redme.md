/cmd/gomon: Contains the main application entry point. This is where the CLI parsing happens, and it's the starting point that orchestrates the rest of the application.
/internal/watcher: Logic for watching file system events. This could use a package like fsnotify to detect changes in the file system.
/internal/builder: Handles the building of the Go project when changes are detected. This involves invoking the Go build process programmatically.
/internal/config: For parsing and managing the configuration file. This will define structures to match the expected JSON configuration and load them at runtime.
/internal/logger: A logging component to output information, warnings, and errors. Helpful for debugging and user feedback.
/internal/notifier: (Optional) For sending desktop notifications or other types of alerts when builds succeed or fail.
/pkg: Contains reusable packages that could be extracted as libraries. Think about separating concerns that might be useful in other projects as well.
